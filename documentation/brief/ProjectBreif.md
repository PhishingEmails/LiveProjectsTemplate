# Brief

This project looks for you to develop a button in Outlook and Office365’s email clients whereby if a user receives a suspected phishing email, then can click a ‘Report It’ style button that is shown within the email client.  This would then send the email to a designated inbox within an organisation to look at.  Also, the user should receive an automated ‘thank you’ style message for making the report.  In addition, if possible, you should aim to include the ability to maintain statistics on reporting (i.e. who made report, how many have they made previously, which company etc). 

To test this, you will need to think about the use of simulated phising emails, which might be sent from a host organisation – can your team think of a way to include a feature such that if the end user successfully reports one of the organisations own simulated phishing emails (possibly via the domain it is sent from or the email header?) the end user receives confirmation that they have successfully reported a simulated email.

This would allow the organisation to ‘train’ their users on reporting suspicious emails.
